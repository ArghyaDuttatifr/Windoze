#1st_class

uniform deviates


non- uniform  1. gaussian , 2. exponential


"Transformation Method "
y = -ln(x)
p(y) = mod ( dy/dx )* P(x)

"Box Muller Method"
y1= np.sqrt(-2*np.log(x))* np.cos(2*np.pi*  x1)

"Rejection Method" ->

**Test of randomness - 
#2nd class 

random number in curvilinear space 
Pearson paper(1900)
chi square test 
KS test 

"Frequentist Statistics"
prob. is might not equal to freq. ..  ,  .. fundamentally worng to assign the freq. in every time

Bayesian Statistics


#3rd class 

Monte Carlo integration
I/A = k/N    ............k = selected pt.s , N = total pt.s  , probility of sucess = I/A
\sigma = variance = sqrt(var(k))*A/N = sqrt (I(A-I)/N)

# Mean value Method
integration of any f(x) = I = Mean of f(x)* (b - a)
variance = (b-a) sqrt(var(f)/N)
#Importance sampling 
diverge func. have a problem 
I = ave( f(x/w(x))) / int (dx w(x))
from N random no. , pnts are in func -> probility\= V*p(x) dx
#optimization sampling 
MCMC Method - it gives us random numbers from a func

#4th class

"probilistic inference"
data <-> model
data = x , f(x) , sigma(y)

baseyian 
Monte Carlo algorithm of probilistic inference
P(i th data = yi)   ... Generated model 
liklihood
